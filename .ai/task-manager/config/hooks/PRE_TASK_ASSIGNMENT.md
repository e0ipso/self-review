# PRE_TASK_ASSIGNMENT Hook

This hook executes before task assignment to determine the most appropriate agent for each task
based on skill requirements and available sub-agents.

## Agent Selection and Task Assignment

- For each task in the current phase:
  - Read task frontmatter to extract the `skills` property (array of technical skills)
  - Analyze task requirements and technical domain from description
  - Match task skills against available sub-agent capabilities
  - Select the most appropriate sub-agent (if any are available). If no sub-agent is appropriate,
    use the general-purpose one.
  - Consider task-specific requirements from the task document

[IMPORTANT] Analyze the set of tasks skills in order to engage any relevant assistant skills as
necessary (either global or project skills).

## Available Sub-Agents

Analyze the sub-agents available in your current assistant's agents directory. If none are available
or the available ones do not match the task's requirements, then use a generic agent.

## Matching Criteria

Select agents based on:

1. **Primary skill match**: Task technical requirements from the `skills` array in task frontmatter
2. **Domain expertise**: Specific frameworks or libraries mentioned in task descriptions
3. **Task complexity**: Senior vs. junior agent capabilities
4. **Resource efficiency**: Avoid over-provisioning for simple tasks

## Skills Extraction and Agent Detection

Read task skills and select appropriate task-specific agent:

```bash
# Extract skills from task frontmatter
TASK_SKILLS=$(node "$root/config/scripts/extract-task-skills.cjs" "$TASK_FILE")

echo "Task skills required: $TASK_SKILLS"

# Check for available sub-agents across assistant directories
AGENT_FOUND=false
for assistant_dir in .claude .gemini .opencode; do
    if [ -d "$assistant_dir/agents" ] && [ -n "$(ls $assistant_dir/agents 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
        echo "Available sub-agents detected in $assistant_dir - will match to task requirements"
        AGENT_FOUND=true
        break
    fi
done

if [ "$AGENT_FOUND" = false ]; then
    echo "Using general-purpose agent for task execution"
fi
```

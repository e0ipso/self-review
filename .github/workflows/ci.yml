# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline for self-review
#
# This workflow runs three parallel test jobs (Lint, Unit Tests, E2E Tests) on every
# push to main and every PR targeting main.
#
# IMPORTANT: The E2E job disables AppArmor's unprivileged user namespace restriction
# (kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns) because Ubuntu 24.04 enables it by
# default, which prevents Electron/Chromium from launching. This is a known issue:
